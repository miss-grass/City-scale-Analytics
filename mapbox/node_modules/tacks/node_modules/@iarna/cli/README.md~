# @iarna/cli

Some simple CLI scaffolding for promise returning applications.

## EXAMPLE

### Without Yargs

If you don't have yargs installed as a dependency then you get arguments
split out but no option parsing:

`example.js`
```js
require('@iarna/cli')(main)

const util = require('util');
const sleep = util.promisify(setTimeout);

// opts will only contain the _ var, for compatibility with yargs
async function main (opts, arg1, arg2, arg3) {
  console.log('Got:', arg1, arg2, arg3)
  await sleep(40)
}
```

### With Yargs

If you do have yargs installed as a dependency you can customize it further
by chaining off the require in the usual yargsish way.

`example.js`
```js
require('@iarna/cli')(main)
  .boolean('silent')
  .boolean('exit')
  .boolean('error')
  .boolean('reject')
  .boolean('code50')
  .version()
  .help()

const util = require('util');
const sleep = util.promisify(setTimeout);

function main (opts, arg1, arg2, arg3) {
  if (!opts.silent) console.error('Starting up!')
  console.log('Got:', arg1, arg2, arg3)
  if (opts.exit) process.exit()
  if (opts.error) throw new Error('throw')
  if (opts.reject) return Promise.reject(new Error('reject'))
  if (opts.code50) return Promise.reject(50)
  return sleep(10000)
}

// alternatively use:
// function main (opts, ...args) {
```

```console
$ node example hello there world
Starting up!
Got: hello there world
$ node example hello there world
Starting up!
Got: hello there world
^C
Abnormal exit: SIGINT
$ node example --silent hello there world
Got: hello there world
$ node example --silent hello there world --exit
Got: hello there world
Abnormal exit: Promises not resolved
$ node example --silent hello there world --error
Got: hello there world
Error: throw

    at tryOnImmediate (timers.js:762:5)
    at processImmediate [as _immediateCallback] (timers.js:733:5)
$ node example --silent hello there world --reject

$ node example --silent hello there world --code50
Got: hello there world
$ echo $?
50
```

## WHAT YOU GET

* _exit without resolving warnings_ - If your program finishes without
  resolving its promises (like if it crashes hard or you process.exit, or you just don't resolve the promise ) then
  we warn about that.
* If your entry point function rejects then that's reported with a stack
  trace (if the rejected value has `.stack`) else with the rejected value
  and your process will exit with an error code.
* If you add `yargs` as a dependency then it will be taken advantage of.
  The wrapper around the main function returns a yargs object, so you can
  configure it as usual.  The `argv` object is passed in as the first
  argument of your entry point function.  The rest of your positional
  arguments are passed in as the remaining function arguments.
* If you add `update-notifier` as a dependency then it will be taken
  advantage of.  A default update notifier is setup for your app so users
  will learn about new versions when you publish them.  Your app needs to
  have a name, version and bin entry in its `package.json`.  (The bin entry
  needs to have the script using `@iarna/cli` in it for the update notifier
  to trigger.)

## WHAT ITS NOT

A full framework for writing cli apps.  You'll likely outgrow the error
handling pretty fast if this is anything beyond a little one off.  This
mostly exists to scratch my own itch.  I kept on writing this code and I
wanted to stop.  =D

It's designed to be only be as heavy as it needs to be.  It only has one
direct dependency, but it can provide enhanced functionality if you depend on
`yargs` or `update-notifier`.

## USAGE

### require('@iarna/cli')(entryPointFunction) → [yargs]

The module itself exports a function that you need to call with the name of
your main function.  Your main function is like `main` in C, it's the entry
point for your program.  It needs to return a promise that resolves when
your program completes.

The return value from the call is, if you have `yargs` installed, a `yargs`
object you can use to configure what options your script takes. If you
don't have yargs installed then it's a proxy that throws if you try to do
anything with it.

Your entry point function can be named anything, but it needs to return a
promise and it takes arguments like this:

`main(opts, arg1, arg2, …, argn) → Promise`

If you have `yargs` installed then the `opts` argument is `yargs.argv`
and the additional arguments are from `argv._`, so `arg1 === argv._[0]`,
`arg2 === argv._[1]` and so on.

If you don't have `yargs` installed then `opts` argument is an object with
an `_` property containing all arguments, for compatibility with the `yargs`
mode.  As with that mode `arg1 === argv._[0]`, `arg2 === argv._[1]` and so
on.
